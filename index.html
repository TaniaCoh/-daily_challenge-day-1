		The Stormlight Archive is the 2nd volume of a 10 books saga.
		On the planet Roshar, a world of stones swept by storms, a violent conflict rages for several years between ten armed forces against one enemy. As the storms get stronger and stronger, a mysterious past slowly resurfaces, with the orders of the Radiant Knights who deserted millennia earlier. Only their relics remain, swords and armors conferring superhuman abilities, and for which the nations are ready to tear each other apart.
